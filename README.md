# Cubscout
Cubscout is an application for scouting matches in FIRST Robotics Competition. Scouting is the process of tracking the performance of other robotics teams in their matches in order to make educated decisions. Cubscout focuses on alliance selection, wherin the higher-ranking teams after qualifying rounds choose teams for their alliance of three to compete in the playoffs.

# Motivation
Many teams, ours formerly included, use paper scouting forms and simple spreadsheets for scouting. This is an extremely cumbersome process and locks teams in to tracking what they expected to be important at the time they printed off the scouting sheets. Cubscout aims to allow teams to track detailed information that is important to them and change what information is relevent without losing the progress they made.
